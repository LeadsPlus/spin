[ ] Allow users to load whatever they want (besides just config/application.rb)
    Maybe in a local .spin file?

[ ] Since we already have the environment preloaded, why couldn't we use that to fork off a rails console? 
    or rails server? `spin console`

[ ] Can we someone get it to run single tests? Like the -n /foo_test/ option.

[ ] Test with different app frameworks. config/application is obviously rails-specific. This depends on item #1.

[ ] Test with different tools. Can it work with watchr? autotest?
